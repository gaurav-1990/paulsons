            <h1>THE IDEA</h1>
            <p>Paulsons&trade; was born to share our idea of shopping and our love for India’s rich art &amp; heritage. Since
1984, it has been our constant endeavour to provide the best of Indian art through beautifully
designed apparels to our patrons &amp; also give them a memorable experience. As we feel that
shopping is not just a task but a way of exploring the world around us. So, when our patrons visit
our stores we do not just fulfil their needs but we also make sure that they have a great time.</p>
            
            <h2>WHAT WE DO</h2>
            <p>
                Paulsons&trade; is one of the leading retailers in Haryana in ethnic apparels for women segment. We
strive towards providing our patrons with the most contemporary &amp; widest collection of Un-stitched
Fabrics, Sarees, Readymades, Shawls &amp; Stoles.
            </p>
            <h2>HOW WE DO IT </h2>
            <p>The entire team of Paulsons&trade; is very much focussed in understanding their customer's innate

trends.</p>
            <p>
                Be it a casual Kurti for the regular office wear or a dress for the friend’s wedding or a Sari for any
special occasion, we make sure that every Paulsons&trade; design is a unique blend of tradition and
trend. Our Products are the unique amalgamation of latest colours, cuts and traditional techniques
curated by the craftsmen, artisans and weavers from different corners of India.

            <h2>PAULSONSONLINE.COM</h2>
            <p>
                We presently serve our patrons from our two physical stores in Faridabad &amp; Rohtak respectively.
This leaves many of our loyal customers from different parts of the country &amp; abroad asking for
more. So, we have created an online front with the aim of extending our shopping experience to
our people who can’t visit us physically. They can view the products here and get in touch with us if
they like something as buying option has not been added on the website yet. We have created this
platform to showcase few of our best designs online as putting up the entire collection is not
possible to maintain the exclusivity of our designs.
